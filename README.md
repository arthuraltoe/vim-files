# Douglas Camata's VIM Files

This is my personal vim files. Any sugestion or bug, please, create an issue.

## Install

Just run ``make`` to install it. 

## IMPORTANT!

When you run ``make``, the script will **backup** your ``.vimrc`` and ``.gvimrc`` by adding
``.bkp`` in their filenames.
 
If you want to **restore** your old settings, just run ``make restore_backup``.
